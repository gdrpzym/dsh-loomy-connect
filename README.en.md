# DSH Loomy Connect

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

[简体中文](README.md) | English

Exposes the text models bundled with the **Loomy** desktop app to [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai) (DSH), without an API key.

The plugin reads Loomy's on-disk sign-in session and model manifest read-only. Nothing is copied, uploaded, or rewritten.

| Contribution | Surface | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Model provider | Host | Registers a `loomy` provider; the model list is discovered from Loomy at startup |
| Settings card | Browser | Shows the signed-in account, credit balance, and served model count under **Settings → Plugin configuration** |

## Features

- **Zero configuration**: once installed and enabled, Loomy's models appear directly in DSH's model selector.
- **Model auto-discovery**: the account's model list is fetched at startup; only models with text output are served.
- **Rates and promos**: the settings card lists every model with its points multiplier (`x3.0`) and flags limited-time free ones, following Loomy's own numbers.
- **Account and credits**: the settings card shows the signed-in account, long-lived credits, and daily credits — read from the same data Loomy's own UI renders from.
- **Bilingual**: card copy follows the DSH interface language.

## Installation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Loomy desktop app** | Installed and signed in at least once |
| **DeepSeek Harness** | `>= 0.1.5-rc.1` |
| **Node.js** | `>= 22` |

From GitHub:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:gdrpzym/dsh-loomy-connect
dsh web
```

From a local checkout — preferred while developing, since it needs no publish step:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/dsh-loomy-connect
dsh web
```

Verifying:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config     # expect an `llm-loomy` entry
```

`--dump-config` only composes the config tree; it does not instantiate the plugin. To confirm the plugin actually boots, run `dsh web` and check for **Loomy** in the model selector.

## Configuration

Paths are auto-detected per platform, so configuration is normally unnecessary. The overrides below target non-standard installs.

| Variable | Overrides |
|---|---|
| `LOOMY_AUTH_FILE` | Sign-in session `auth-session.json` path |
| `LOOMY_CONFIG_FILE` | Model manifest `opencode.json` path |
| `LOOMY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` | Credits cache `Local Storage/leveldb` directory |

Resolution order per lookup: **plugin config (`authFile` / `configFile`) → environment variable → detected default**.

Default paths are probed across macOS and Windows; the first existing path wins:

| Platform | Sign-in session | Model manifest | Credits cache |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/loomy/auth-session.json` | `%APPDATA%/loomy-opencode/opencode.json` | `%APPDATA%/loomy/Local Storage/leveldb` |

## Security model

| Boundary | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Network exposure | Gateway binds `127.0.0.1` only |
| Client authentication | Per-process random secret, compared with `timingSafeEqual` |
| DNS rebinding | `Host` must be loopback |
| Cross-site simple requests | `Origin`, when sent, must be loopback; request body must be `application/json` |
| Token custody | The Loomy session token is read from disk inside the gateway per request; DSH never holds it |

Threat model: protects against other local processes and against web pages running in the user's browser. It does **not** protect against code running as the same user, which can read the same files the plugin reads.

## Known limitations

- Depends on Loomy's client interface (not an official public API); Loomy updates may require plugin changes.
- The model list and its rates come from Loomy's API; when it is unreachable the plugin falls back to Loomy's generated config, and only then to a built-in snapshot.
- Credits are read from Loomy's local cache — Loomy exposes no credits endpoint. When no cache exists the card omits credits rather than showing 0.
- The model manifest is read at startup; restart DSH after Loomy adds or removes models.
- If the sign-in path is not detected on Windows, set `LOOMY_AUTH_FILE` explicitly.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Card never appears under Plugin configuration | Host half did not register the namespace; see item 4 in [docs/internals.en.md](docs/internals.en.md#browser-half) |
| Plugin listed under Plugins but no card | Same as above — the Plugins tab reflects installed entries, not served namespaces |
| `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'authFile')` at boot | Missing runtime `Config` export; see [docs/internals.en.md](docs/internals.en.md#cordis-config-schema) |
| Card shows "not signed in" though Loomy is signed in | Session path not detected; set `LOOMY_AUTH_FILE` |
| `502` on every chat request | Gateway could not read a valid session, usually a path detection problem |
| Model list is stale | Restart DSH or trigger a settings change |
| Credits empty | Loomy has not cached a summary yet, or `LOOMY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` is wrong |
